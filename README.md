# Health-monitoring-system-has-become-accessible-to-every-corner-of-the-world-with-the-internet.-Prope

Health monitoring system has become accessible to every corner of the world with the internet. Proper aggregation of necessary medical data is very relevant for treatment, inadequate security often exposes the data to an unknown threat. In this paper, an Internet of things based e-Health monitoring system is proposed where various types of sensors are used to collect data about health-related and environment-related parameters and transmit them to the cloud. Schedule data aggregation is provided in the proposed system to reduce energy consumption and bandwidth. Proper privacy and security have become the major concern to avoid unauthorized users. So, the data are stored securely, redundant data can be avoided easily. People can smoothly maintain a record of their health condition and can also take proper precautions with the help of the information provided by these systems. Thus, we have tried to build a system that is compact, cost-effective. and handy.
